= Parables =

= Why? =

- To veil the meaning
- Conveys to the hearer religious truth exactly in proportion to our faith and intelligence
   - To the dull an uninspired it's just a story.
   - "Seeing they see not"
   - *Only he who seeks finds* #[[scripturestudy]]
   - For people who are spiritual it reveals the mysteries or secrets of the kingdom of heaven
   - Greek
      - side by side
      - a comparison

= Interpretation of Parables =

*Remember:* what the only true interpretation is the one _meant_ to be conveyed in the context 
of *when* they where given.

- This is probably a reason why recent things in the church are sometimes better than scriptures
- Be careful to not connect too much with the imagery of the story, it will break eventually
- Note sometimes the same analogy can be used for good and evil!
