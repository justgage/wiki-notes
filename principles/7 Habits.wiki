= Great achievers = 

Covey talks about great achievers expressing their voice through the use of their intelligences; for example:

Great achievers develop their mental energy into vision

Great achievers develop their physical energy into discipline

Great achievers develop their emotional energy into passion

Great achievers develop their spiritual energy into conscience – their inward 
moral sense of what is right and wrong and their drive towards meaning and contribution.[2]

= Abundance mentality =

A person believes there are enough resources and successes to share with others.
He contrasts it with the scarcity mindset (i.e., destructive and unnecessary 
competition), which is founded on the idea that, if someone else wins or is 
successful in a situation, that means you lose; not considering the 
possibility of all parties winning (in some way or another) in a given 
situation (see zero-sum game)
