= True Object Oriented =

The creator of the ideas behind [[OO]] is ______. And his ideas got implemented in [[Java]].

Focues on _Message Passing_ verses focusing on Objects.

Isoloation instead of Encapsolation. This means not only is the object only deal with itself
but also only lets others deal with it at a distance. AKA: stays decopled even from things
that use it. This is not true at all for [[Java]]; However is very true for [[Erlang]] which may
be the only true object oriented language (and [[Elixir]] by assosiation).
