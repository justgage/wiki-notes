= Java =

A language that takes [[OO]] to an extreme. Used heavily in production.

Pros:
* Used a lot
* [[Garbage collection]] which is better than [[C]] style [[Manual Memory mannagement]]
* Good [[IDEs]] and [[refactoring]] tools.

Cons
* [[OO]] and not [[TOO]]
* [[FP]] is painful
* Native Concurrency is painful (without some good libraries)
