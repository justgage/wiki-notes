== Comunity == 

"Erlang programmers are a bit similar to Lispers in that they will tend to write libraries
that will solve their problems and not really test or try them in other circumstances, 
leaving it to you to extend or fix issues that arise in new contexts.  It’s thus
pretty much guaranteed you’ll have to go dive in some code base you know"

== OTP ==

=== What is it? ===
Stands for "Open Telecom Platform!" although now it's more about:

- The OTP framework takes care of [cocurrent application gotchas]
by grouping these essential practices into a set of libraries that have been 
carefully engineered and battle- hardened over years. Every Erlang programmer should use 
them.

<http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp>

OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to 
develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications 
to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling 
tools.
