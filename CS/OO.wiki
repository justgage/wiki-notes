= Object Oriented = 

I have very mixed feelings about things being [[Object Oriented]].

Reasons:
* OO models things as the world works
   * Good for simulations
   * Bad for reliablility due to the problems with [[state]]
* Hides away [[state]].
* Says nouns are bigger than verbs which often is not the case
   * Nouns escoting verbs around.
* Not true to [[TOO]]
