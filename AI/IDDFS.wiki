= Iterative deepening depth-first search =

A [[DLS]] done where it continues to to increase the limit till we find a goal node

Seems grossly wasteful but in fact most of the nodes are in the bottom so it isn't too bad.

Combines the benifits of [[DFS]] and [[BFS]].

_is prefered when uninformed search method when the search space is large and the depth of the solution is not known_
