= AND-OR-GRAPH-SERCH =


[[OR nodes]] and [[AND nodes]] (two intertwining recursive functions)

- [[OR nodes]] (circle)
- [[AND nodes]] 

- lines = actions 

Process of thinking
- State -> Actor acts -> Environment reacts in many possible ways (branches) -> States

Process of really doing it
- Actor acts -> Environment reacts -> Actor acts....


*PURPOSE*: Looking for a [[contigency plan]]!


CO -> call the or-search
CA -> call the and-search
RO -> return from or-search
RA -> return from and-search
