= Heuristic =

Heuristic functions estimate costs of shortest paths
 
Can dramatically reduce search cost!

Every state has a heuristic associated with it ([[optimistic]] amount of moves you have to make)

* Are there heuristics that are [[admissable]] and not [[consistant]]?
   - Very few do.



EG: Indiana Jones trying to stuff as much valuables in to our knapsack
heuristic = (value*sizeMax)/size

Good heuristics are hard to find!

== multiple heuristics ==
(both [[admissible]]) dominance -> one is always equal to or greater to the other (no sense of using the other)

Always take the MAX

== how to get a good one? ==
- no solid way 

[[Traveling salisman]] -> change to a minimum spanning tree and then your much easier
