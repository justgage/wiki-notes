= Readings Report =

- Deterministic -> Schocastic
   - Not really sure whats going to happen
   - Act before they have a fool-proof plan
      - Acting often gives you more information!
         - Why failing in learning is so important

- We would like the [[agent]] to act rationaly even though it lacks infromation
- Event Observable / determistic Envivornments may be unknown when search begins.
   - Like a maze
- precepts are useful when nondetermistic or partially obserable.
- Looking for a plan that will work no matter what. (probably not going to happen very often, but you can get close)

- [[AND-OR-GRAPH-SERCH]]
- Solution is a sub-tree with
   - goal node at every leaf
   - One action for [[OR node]]
   - Includes every outcome for each [[AND node]]
   - If you can't find this you can't find a *for sure* solution
