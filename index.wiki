= Gage's Wiki =

Hello, This is the homepage of Gage Peterson. I'm a [[CS/index|Computer Science]] student at [[http://www.byui.edu|BYU-I]]

I'm a lover of [[books]] (mostly about programming).

I have a place to collect [[principles/index|principles]].

Or perhaps to write a [[manifesto]].

There's also a [[diary/diary|Blog]].

School notes: [[TODO]]
