Thoughts:
- They are all related
- Rappidly change levels of Abstraction
- Pay the price then _come talk to brother Neff_

you create the criteara for the "Goodness of your algorithms"

== Part 1 ==
Implement ~Figure out~ how to Solve it

== Part 2 ==
Figure out how to solve it

Factorization helps with melt

Can't have duplicate values

then use systems for solving linear equations [[Linear Algorithms]]

Groups of letters that equal! eg: (P + L + N)


=== Algorithm 1 ===
Randomly choose numbers for all letters

=== Algorithm 2 ===

Information we can gather:
- GCD will find the starting number for c if all c is the same (same for v)
   - works when lots of similar words
- Find both divisors


=== Algorithm 3 ===


== Part 3 ==
Figure out what the question is.

- Pray! (about the algorithm)
