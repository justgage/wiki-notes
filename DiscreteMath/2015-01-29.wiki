= Review for Test 2 =
- [[pancake]] problem?

- 13 questions?
   - Many of them are worth multiple points
- [[DFS]] 
- [[BFS]]
- [[topological sorting|Topological sorting]]

(incomplete) Breath-first search [[BFS]]
Can you follow this algorithm
- While queue not empty
- ....
- If W is marked with 0 (unvisited)
- Initialize a count var
- Increment count to mark each with the counting order
- Add W to the queue
- remove the front vertex from the queue
 
 (handout?)
 
= Josephus Problem =
what do we need to know?
- how the recurrence works

= What's on the test? =
- [[BFS]] fill in the 5 blanks for the correct words 1 word per blank
- Tie breaker = Alphabetical (lexicographic)
- Find the order with [[DFS]]
- 22 points for both of those!

- 86 points is about half
- Apply the [[source removal]] problem using [[topological sorting]]
- [ ] Learn multiplication ala ruse
   - 13 blanks on question 10
   - Multiplication of 2 digit numbers
- [ ] [[fake coin]]
   - [ ] know the number of comparisons log base 3?
      - [ ] know base by [[branching factor]]
   - [ ] Different algorithms?


= Merge sort Algorithm =
- Spit array A 1..n into two and make copies of each array
- sort arrays B and C using Merge sort recursively
- Merge sort efficiently O(n log n)
- Space requirement O(n) when NOT in-place)
- Can be done recursively
- Can be done 
-
