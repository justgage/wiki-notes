= Quicksort Algorithm in words = 

- Spit the list into two parts
- Put all the larger on the right smaller than or equal to on the left
(recursive)


Best case:
equal sizes in the 

Average case: n log n

Worst case : n^2


Make it better?
- Better pivot selection
- Switch to insertion sort on small subfiles
- elimination of recursion

Best for Quicksort is considered the method of choice 
for _internal_ sorting of large files (n >= 10000)

[[insertion sort]]

Java.array util <- uses QS 
- uses insertion sort on 7 or less (QS calls it recursivly)

[[Inquizitiveness]] 10,000 <- is the smallest you test
