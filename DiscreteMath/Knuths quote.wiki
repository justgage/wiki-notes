Donald Knuth's quote about [[algorithm|algorithmic]] thinkers, 
and if not, I will consider using the help provided by http://www.memorizenow.com/.

    Computer Science and Engineering is a field that attracts a different kind 
    of thinker.
    
    I believe that one who is a _natural computer scientist_ thinks algorithmically.
    
    Such people are especially good at dealing with situations where _different rules_ apply in _different cases_;
    
    they are individuals who can _rapidly change levels of [[CS/abstraction|abstraction]].
    
    simultaneously seeing things “in the large” and “in the small.”
