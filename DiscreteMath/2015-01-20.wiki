Fail at Problem 3 of [[Mysteriousness]] if you don't pay the price.

"Far easier then I thought" ~ students who help

He will only show you if you have "skin in the game".


[[Finding the witnesses]] 
try easiest ones c = 1 or k = 1

= Brute forcing =

Mystery function <zz, zz> return -> string
   -> finds the prime factorization of a number!
   
   [[Mysteriousness]] part 2??

better ways for these?
- [[Magic Squares]]
- [[String matching]] O(nm)
- [[Closest Pair]]
- [[Convex hull]]
- [[Exhaustive Search]]

"what's the cardinality of the power set...?" => 2^n

[[Knapsack Problem]]

= [[Graph Searching]] Algorithms =
== Depth first search ([[DFS]]) ==
== Breadth first search ([[BFS]]) ==

Which to use? Same (basicly) [[bigO]] value.

Thursday: 3 hours in problem 3 in [[Mysteriousness]]
